Running Arbitrary Spatial SQL
=============================

If you have installed the PostGIS database, the Medford data, and Tomcat, you should be able to view the functioning example here:

  http://localhost:8080/spatialdbtips/05-arbitrary-sql.html
  
In the last example, we showed features being drawn based on SQL passed through a script that output GeoJSON. Once you have a script like that, the next step is to simply hand it any old SQL you feel like, and that is what this example shows.

Choosing a query from the drop-down list makes the SQL available for editing before it is submitted to the database for retrieval.

The first example just retrieves all the school points. Note that we transform them into the "900913" coordinate reference system, so they line up with our base map.

.. code-block:: sql

  select 
    st_asgeojson(
      st_transform(the_geom,900913)
    ) 
  from 
    medford.schools
    
You can make the query more exciting by wrapping the **the_geom** term in an **ST_Buffer()** function to turn the points into larger circles. **ST_Buffer()** the points by 2500 feet. Whoa, big circles!

Now, wrap the **ST_Buffer()** in an **ST_Union()**. All the overlapping portions are melted away.

The second example spatially joins the school points to the buildings layer. How can we find school buildings? How about buildings that contain a school point.

.. code-block:: sql

  select 
    st_asgeojson(
      st_transform(st_force_2d(buildings.the_geom),900913)
    ) 
  from 
    medford.buildings buildings, 
    medford.schools schools
  where
    st_contains(buildings.the_geom, schools.the_geom)

The call to **ST_Contains()** gives us all the buildings containing school points. Note the **ST_Force_2d()** call at the top -- that is needed because the buildings data is actually 3D! Unfortunately, OpenLayers only understands 2D GeoJSON, so if you feed it 3D features it fails to draw them. Fortunately, the database has the tools to reduce the dimensionality.

The third example is just like the second, except using tax lots. 

.. code-block:: sql

  select 
    st_asgeojson(
      st_transform(taxlots.the_geom,900913)
    ) 
  from 
    medford.taxlots taxlots, 
    medford.schools schools 
  where 
    st_contains(taxlots.the_geom,schools.the_geom)

Try wrapping the geometry in an **ST_Centroid()** to turn the lots back into points.  Or, move the geometries 500 feet to the right, by using **ST_Translate(the_geom,500,0)**.

The fourth example pulls linear features, streets, that are nearby to the school points.

.. code-block:: sql

  select 
    st_asgeojson(
      st_transform(streets.the_geom,900913)
   ) 
   from 
    medford.streets streets, 
    medford.schools schools 
  where 
    st_dwithin(schools.the_geom, streets.the_geom, 500) 

Again, you can buffer the streets to create hotdog shapes.

.. image:: ./img/arbitrary-sql2.png

The final example is fairly complex. It takes the school points, buffers them into circles, then intersects those circles with the tax lots, to create circular "tax lot cookies" (mmmMMMmmm).

.. code-block:: sql

  select 
    st_asgeojson(
      st_transform(
        st_intersection(
          taxlots.the_geom, 
          st_buffer(schools.the_geom,500)
        ),
        900913
      )
    ) 
  from 
    medford.schools schools, 
    medford.taxlots taxlots, 
    medford.wards wards 
  where 
    st_dwithin(schools.the_geom, taxlots.the_geom, 500) 
  and 
    st_contains(wards.the_geom,schools.the_geom) 
  and 
    wards.wards_id = 3
  
In order to make it run a little faster, the calculation is further restricted by spatially joining to the wards and only doing the calculation in ward #3.
